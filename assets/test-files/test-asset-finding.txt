THE PURPOSE OF THIS FILE IS TO TEST ASSET FINDING.
BOTH THE MAIN EXECUTABLE AND THE EXTERNAL-TESTS EXECUTABLE SHOULD HAVE A TEST CASE TRYING TO OPEN THIS FILE.
IF THIS FILE CANNOT BE OPENED, THEN THE PATH_TO_ASSETS_DIRECTORY MACRO IS LIKELY INVALID.
IF IT IS INVALID (e.g. DUE TO THE PATH CHANGING ON DISK SINCE CMAKE BUILD), A CMAKE REBUILD COULD UPDATE IT PROPERLY.
